  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom:1.6rem;">
    XBI (Experimental Behavioral Instrument) devices are touchscreen-based cognitive
    testing and enrichment systems that allow monkeys to voluntarily interact with
    structured tasks directly from their home enclosure. This replaces traditional
    chair-based setups and dramatically improves both welfare and data throughput.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom:1.6rem;">
    I designed, built, and deployed these systems for <strong>Rhesus macaques, Common
    Marmosets, and Long-tailed macaques</strong>. The devices run autonomously,
    register individual animals via RFID or vision-based ID, and automatically adjust
    task difficulty, reward delivery, and trial structure.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom:1.6rem;">
    Because animals can interact freely at any time of day, the XBIs enable
    <strong>large-scale high-throughput testing</strong> and reduce reliance on
    restraint-based methods. Animals perform hundreds of trials per day while choosing
    tasks spontaneously, which generates rich behavioural datasets with minimal human
    intervention.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom:1.6rem;">
    The systems include integrated modules for <strong>auditory psychophysics</strong>,
    <strong>motion perception</strong>, <strong>multiple-choice interfaces</strong>,
    and <strong>visuo-acoustic discrimination</strong>. Each module automatically logs
    behavioural data in structured formats for downstream analysis.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom:1.6rem;">
    The XBI approach has been adopted across multiple institutions and has contributed
    to publications demonstrating the scientific and ethical advantages of autonomous,
    home-cage-based cognitive training.
