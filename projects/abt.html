  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom: 1.6rem;">
    In this project I am lead developer and coordinator of a group of engineers and data scientists
    belonging to different research groups at the Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory (CNL) of the
    German Primate Center. Here I designed and led the development of a stand-alone software to
    track, identify, and extract the posture of rhesus macaques in their enclosure with
    the aim of autonomously assessing animals’ welfare and behaviour 24/7 without direct interference.

  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom: 1.6rem;">
    The system coordinates a network of synchronized cameras, GPU-based inference modules,
    and centralized data-management pipelines to support continuous, high-throughput acquisition,
    compression, analysis, and reporting.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom: 1.6rem;">
    High-resolution video streams are captured by up to 16 Hikrobot GigE cameras,
    connected through a dedicated network switch and synchronized via PTP or software
    triggering. These streams are transmitted to a distributed GPU cluster, where a
    2D Prediction moduleperforms real-time object detection, keypoint extraction, and
    individual animal identification.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom: 1.6rem;">
    Each node in the cluster employs TensorRT-optimized CNNs, trained and fine-tuned
    through custom modules (Model Training and Model Optimization). Every processed frame
    generates structured outputs—including bounding boxes, anatomical keypoints, and identity
    labels—which are automatically logged and archived into text-based databases.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom: 1.6rem;">
    Processed outputs from the GPU cluster are transmitted to a Server computer, where
    3D Calibration, 3D Transformation, and 3D Localization modules reconstruct
    absolute spatial positions from synchronized camera pairs. Calibration follows checkerboard-based
    stereo recordings using the JARVIS protocol (jarvis-mocap.github.io), generating
    intrinsic/extrinsic parameters and distortion coefficients for each camera.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom: 1.6rem;">
    Transformation matrices are then computed to project all 2D coordinates into a unified world
    reference frame, enabling accurate 3D pose reconstruction and multi-animal
    tracking across large experimental spaces. The data server manages compression, indexing,
    and long-term storage of video and derivative datasets, ensuring reproducibility and accessibility.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom: 1.6rem;">
    Users interact with the system via the ABT graphical interface from a client computer,
    which integrates tools for acquisition scheduling, system monitoring, and visualization of processed
    results. The GUI also links to automated analysis modules that routinely compute behavioral readouts
    and statistical summaries directly from processed data.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom: 1.6rem;">
    This automated architecture is designed to allow researchers to focus on analysis and interpretation,
    while simultaneously enhancing reproducibility and standardization
    across experimental setups and research questions.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom: 1.6rem;">
    The ABT software is planned to reach alpha state in early 2026, when it will be set as public on github
    and thus made accessible to institutions outside the German Primate Center.
