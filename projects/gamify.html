  <p class="project-description">
    Since 2022 I am designing, programming, and testing psychophysical experiments
    that incorporate gaming elements, to study Cognition, Motion Processing,
    Decision-Making, and Integration of Social Information.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description">
    Four major projects sparked from this effort:
  </p>

  <ul style="margin-left:1.2rem; margin-bottom:1.2rem; color:var(--fg-muted);">
    <li>An investigation on the validity of gamified psychophysics for the study of motion processing;</li>
    <li>A dyadic, joystick-based game to study the integration of social information in decision-making;</li>
    <li>A multiple-choice user interface optimised for cognitive assessment, enrichment, and psychophysics in monkeys;</li>
    <li>A foraging-like game to study high-level cognitive flexibility in monkeys and humans.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 style="margin-top:1.4rem;">Validity of gamified psychophysics for motion processing</h4>

  <p class="project-description">
    Across three experimental conditions with gradually different levels of gamification
    (Standard, Gamified, Unreal Engine), participants played the exact same motion-perception
    task. Gamification increased satisfaction, reduced dropout rates, and improved motion sensitivity,
    especially in the Unreal Engine condition.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description">
    Participants controlled an avatar that moved left/right by following the global motion of
    a cloud of dots. Obstacles appeared too quickly to react, and could be avoided only by
    correctly interpreting motion direction. Points, levels, and dynamic backgrounds supported
    engagement without compromising psychophysical rigor.
  </p>

  <h4 style="margin-top:1.4rem;">Dyadic joystick game for social-information integration</h4>

  <p class="project-description">
    This task evaluated whether humans integrate social motion cues during decision-making.
    Two players simultaneously navigated using joysticks around a cloud of dots whose motion
    predicted where targets would appear. Each participant saw their own arc and the other
    player’s arc. Data analysis is ongoing and cannot be disclosed publicly yet.
  </p>

  <h4 style="margin-top:1.4rem;">Multiple-choice interface (“Task Bar”) for monkeys</h4>

  <p class="project-description">
    This system, published in 2023 (Animals), allows monkeys to select cognitive enrichment
    tasks from their enclosure — a “dock bar” with three buttons:
  </p>

  <ul style="margin-left:1.2rem; margin-bottom:1.2rem; color:var(--fg-muted);">
    <li>Static reach: touch a red ball</li>
    <li>Dynamic reach: touch a moving red ball</li>
    <li>Watch pictures of conspecifics</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="project-description">
    Monkeys reliably chose their preferred tasks, and button repositioning every hour did not
    affect their preferences. Performance metrics (hit rates across size/speed combinations)
    revealed consistent psychophysical signatures.
  </p>

  <h4 style="margin-top:1.4rem;">Foraging-like cognitive flexibility task</h4>

  <p class="project-description">
    Published in 2022 (Frontiers in Psychology), this complex task assessed rule learning and
    switching in monkeys and humans (including adults and children with/without ADHD). Animals
    played thousands of trials per session with strong engagement.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description">
    Results show that humans are more flexible and abstract in rule learning, but monkeys display
    stable individual styles and domain-general rule learning that does not depend on visual category.
