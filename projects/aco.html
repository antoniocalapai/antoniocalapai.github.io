  <p class="project-description">
    This project explored how natural, socially meaningful sounds can improve learning and
    engagement in cognitive training. Using a fully autonomous touchscreen system designed
    for common marmosets (MXBI), we showed that ecologically valid acoustic cues such as
    conspecific calls lead to faster learning than artificial tones.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description">
    The MXBI system operates directly in home enclosures, where animals voluntarily interact
    with sound-based tasks identified via RFID. The system adapts task difficulty in real time
    and removes the need for social isolation or food deprivation, turning cognitive testing
    into an enrichment activity aligned with natural behaviour.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description">
    The key result: ecological relevance matters. Marmosets learn faster, stay engaged longer,
    and perform better when acoustic cues match their natural perceptual world.

  <h4 style="margin-top:1.4rem;">Figure explanation: learning and motivation</h4>

  <p class="project-description">
    Over repeated sessions, animals consistently improved their ability to associate specific
    acoustic cues with visual choices, performing hundreds of voluntary trials per day without
    supervision. Natural sounds evoked stronger curiosity and sustained motivation compared to
    artificial tones or noise stimuli.
  </p>

  <h4 style="margin-top:1.4rem;">Hearing thresholds</h4>

  <p class="project-description">
    Using an adaptive reward scheme across sound intensities, marmosets’ hearing thresholds were
    automatically estimated in the MXBI system. Psychometric curves revealed thresholds around
    27–49 dB SPL and matched known species-specific hearing ranges.
  </p>

  <h4 style="margin-top:1.4rem;">Sound categories and discrimination</h4>

  <p class="project-description">
    Marmosets discriminated between five sound categories:
  </p>

  <ul style="margin-left:1.2rem; margin-bottom:1.2rem; color:var(--fg-muted);">
    <li>Juvenile calls</li>
    <li>Twitter calls</li>
    <li>Phee calls</li>
    <li>Sine tones</li>
    <li>White noise</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="project-description">
    Natural calls produced faster learning and higher accuracy than artificial sounds. Sensitivity
    measures and hit rates both confirmed superior performance with biologically meaningful stimuli.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description">
    As first author, I developed the hardware, software architecture, adaptive algorithms, and
    behavioural validation framework. The MXBI platform shows that auditory cognition can be
    assessed ethically and fully autonomously inside social enclosures.
