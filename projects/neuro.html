    As part of my electrophysiology work, I investigated how single neurons in the macaque
    Middle Superior Temporal area (MST) encode <strong>motion</strong> and <strong>depth</strong>
    information. Monkeys were trained to fixate a central point, press a button for a dimming
    target, and wear polarised glasses enabling presentation of stimuli at different depths.

  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom:1.6rem;">
    During the task, I recorded extracellular activity while clouds of moving dots varied rapidly
    in motion direction and binocular disparity. This allowed me to map receptive fields and quantify
    joint tuning to motion and depth using <strong>Reverse Correlation</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom:1.6rem;">
    Theory suggested that some MST neurons might act as <strong>self-motion detectors</strong>,
    responding to specific combinations of direction and depth. In practice, I found a diversity
    of tuning profiles:
  </p>

  <ul style="margin-left:1.2rem; margin-bottom:1.6rem; color:var(--fg-muted);">
    <li>specific motion–depth combinations,</li>
    <li>motion-only tuning,</li>
    <li>depth-only tuning,</li>
    <li>mixed or complex patterns.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom:1.6rem;">
    Using <strong>Generalised Additive Models (GAMs)</strong> on 194 neurons, only
    <strong>one</strong> neuron showed tuning consistent with a true self-motion detector. Most neurons
    appeared to provide intermediate building blocks for self-motion processing, but not the complete
    computation itself.
  </p>

  <p class="project-description" style="margin-bottom:1.6rem;">
    These findings indicate that MST does not explicitly encode self-motion. Instead, it provides
    rich motion–depth representations that are likely combined <strong>downstream</strong> to support
    perception of self-movement through space.
